# nsticky

`nsticky` is a window management helper tool built on top of [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri). It focuses on managing **sticky windows** — windows fixed across all workspaces — to enhance your workflow efficiency.

## Why?

Niri doesn’t natively support global floating windows.
This tool forces float windows to persist on every workspace, mimicking the sticky behavior from X11/Wayland compositors like Sway or KWin.

## Features

✨ **Powerful Sticky Window Management:**
Easily fix windows across all workspaces to keep your most important apps visible at all times.

🔧 **Flexible Controls:**
Add or remove windows from the sticky list on demand via intuitive CLI commands.

📋 **Real-time Overview:**
Quickly list all currently sticky windows to stay organized.

⚡ **Instant Toggle:**
Toggle the sticky state of the currently active window with a single command or shortcut.

📦 **Window Staging:**
Temporarily move sticky windows to a dedicated "stage" workspace and restore them to the current workspace when needed.

## Installation

Make sure you have Rust installed along with the required `niri` tool.

### 1. Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lonerOrz/nsticky.git
cd nsticky
cargo build --release
```

### 2. Install via Nix (for Nix or NixOS users)

```bash
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
    nsticky.url = "github:lonerOrz/nsticky";
  };

  outputs =
    inputs@{
      self,
      flake-utils,
      nixpkgs,
      ...
    }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (
      system:
      let
        pkgs = import nixpkgs {
          inherit system;
        };
      in
      {
        devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
          packages = [ inputs.nsticky.packages.${system}.nsticky ];
        };
      }
    );
}
```

### 3. Use precompiled binaries directly

## Usage

### Daemon mode

Configure `niri` to auto-start the `nsticky` daemon:

```bash
spawn-at-startup "nsticky"
```

### Command line

Control `nsticky` from the terminal using CLI commands:

```bash
./target/release/nsticky add <window_id>          # Add a window to the sticky list
./target/release/nsticky remove <window_id>       # Remove a window from the sticky list
./target/release/nsticky list                      # List all sticky windows
./target/release/nsticky toggle-active             # Toggle sticky state of the active window
./target/release/nsticky stage <window_id>         # Move a sticky window to the "stage" workspace
./target/release/nsticky stage --all               # Move all sticky windows to the "stage" workspace
./target/release/nsticky stage --list              # List all currently staged windows
./target/release/nsticky stage --active            # Move the active sticky window to the "stage" workspace
./target/release/nsticky unstage <window_id>       # Move a staged window back to the current active workspace
./target/release/nsticky unstage --all             # Move all staged windows back to the current active workspace
./target/release/nsticky unstage --active          # Move the active staged window back to the current active workspace
```

You can also set up a shortcut in `niri`:

```bash
Mod+Ctrl+Space { spawn "nsticky" "toggle-active"; }
```

## Design

`nsticky` communicates with its daemon via a Unix Domain Socket. The CLI client sends commands while the daemon manages sticky window states.

The daemon also listens to `niri`’s event stream to automatically handle window movement on workspace switches.

---

## Dependencies

🛠️ **Core Libraries:**

- **Tokio:** Asynchronous runtime for smooth, non-blocking IO.
- **Clap:** Robust command-line argument parser.
- **Anyhow:** Simplified error handling for better reliability.
- **Serde / serde_json:** Efficient JSON serialization and deserialization.

🔗 **Integration:**

- **niri:** The window manager integration foundation, enabling seamless event handling.

---

## Notes

- `nsticky` relies on the `niri` window manager.
- The daemon requires the `NIRI_SOCKET` environment variable to connect to Niri.
- The staging feature moves windows to a workspace named "stage". Ensure this workspace exists in your Niri configuration, or it will be created automatically when needed.
